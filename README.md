# Purpose
This was an assignment for one of my networking classes. It started out with some template from the publisher of the textbook, and I then started adding my own code to the project. 

# Running Assignment:
This code has only been tested on Python 2.7, and shouldn't need any additional packages installed. 
The URLs that are also used are hard coded at the bottom of the script.

To run, use: 
> sudo python pinger.py
